  BBCRUD is a sample Backbone.js CRUD application (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate (D)elete developed to learn how to use Backbone.js. I'm using Zend Framework 1.12 on the server end, development & testing is being done on a running OSX Lion.
  
  Thanks to numerous tutorials and example projects found on the web for a majority of the code concepts found in this project.
  
## Features

  * Custom grid that supports sorting, searching and paginating result sets.
  * Basic demonstration of CRUD operations using Backbone.js and Zend Framework.
  * Zend Firebug Database Profiler Asynchronous Query Logging
  
## Technologies

  * Backbone.js 0.9.9
  * Underscore.js 1.4.3
  * jQuery 1.8.3

## Installation

  Look in the docs folder for the example user database. 
  
  * Find the database and load it.
  * Update your application.ini and fill in your MySQL connection information.
  * Setup a virtual host like you normally do for a Zend Framework project.

## Todo

 A lot of testing! This project was created to learn Backbone.js. Any input, help, pull requests or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
