# BBCRUD - A Backbone.js CRUD Application
      
  Nothing much to see here just a sample Backbone.js CRUD application (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate (D)elete developed to learn how to use Backbone.js. I'm using Zend Framework 1.12 on the server end, development & testing is being done on a Macbook Pro running OSX Lion.
  
  Thanks to numerous Backbone.js tutorials and example projects found on the web for a majority of the code concepts found in this project.
  
## Technologies

  * Backbone.js 0.9.2
  * Underscore.js 1.4.3
  * jQuery 1.8.3
  * jQuery UI 1.9.2
  * Jasmine 1.3.1
  * Zend Framework 1.12
  * Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2

## Installation

  Look in the docs folder for a slightly modified version of the [ MySQL Sakila ](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/index.html) example database. 
  
  * Find the database and load it.
  * Update your application.ini and fill in your MySQL connection information.
  * Setup a virtual host like you normally do for a Zend Framework project.

## Todo

 A lot of testing! This project was created to learn Backbone.js. Any input, help, pull requests or ideas would be greatly appreciated. 

 List of todo items:

  * Jasmine testing.
  * Grid column sorting & search capabilities.
  * An AMD version? Probablly so need to learn how to do it.
